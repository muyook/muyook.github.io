    <h1><i>ABOUT ME</i></h1>
    
    <article>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan on December 11, 1997. At a young age,
    I then moved to Southern California, where I grew up. At age seventeen, I moved
    to New York for college, leaving behind my dog. <br>
    I enjoy writing and ingesting inordinate amounts of caffeine. I also have an affinity
    for music, and I play guitar, bass, and piano. <br>
    I am currently a sophomore at Eugene Lang The New School for Liberal Arts as a
    psychology and culture and media double major. </article>
