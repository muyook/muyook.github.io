    <article>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and moved to Southern
    California at a young age, where I grew up. At age seventeen, I moved
    to New York for college, leaving behind a dog.My favorite author is
    Chuck Palahniuk, and my favorite book by him is <i>Lullaby</i>.
    I am currently a sophomore at Eugene Lang The New School for Liberal Arts.
