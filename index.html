    <article>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and moved to Southern
    California at a young age, where I grew up. At age seventeen, I moved
    to New York for college, leaving behind my dog. My favorite author is
    Chuck Palahniuk, and my favorite book by him is <i>Lullaby</i>. I enjoy
    writing and ingesting inordinate amounts of caffeine. I also have an affinity
    for music, and I play guitar, bass, and piano.
    I am currently a sophomore at Eugene Lang The New School for Liberal Arts as a
    psychology and culture and media double major. This is all very generic
    and uninteresting information. </article>
